## GreatSPN (GRaphical Editor and Analyzer for Timed and Stochastic Petri Nets) 

Following description adapted from their website,

GreatSPN is a software package for the modeling, validation, and performance evaluation of distributed systems using Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets and their colored extension, Stochastic Well-formed Nets. The tool provides a friendly framework to experiment with (stochastic) Petri net based modeling techniques. It implements efficient analysis algorithms to allow its use on rather complex applications.

GreatSPN is a tool released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2.

## GreatSPN in MCC
 
GreatSPN competed in the MCC from the 2013 edition and continuously up to 2023.

The current engine used in MCC scenarios is based on [Meddly](https://github.com/asminer/meddly) a powerful decision diagram library and uses very general decision procedures able to deal with CTL* formulas.

GreatSPN embeds its own analysis methods for Colored nets thus can deal with all models, and can handle every examination of the MCC, making it a versatile tool.

In terms of rankings, it is [regularly on the podium for StateSpace](https://yanntm.github.io/MCC-analysis/state_space_annual.html) and can in all categories answer queries other tools cannot particularly hard queries that need to have built the whole state space [The small red and green bars in these diagrams](https://yanntm.github.io/MCC-analysis/invcex/toolinvcexhard.html), but suffers in the MCC scoring from the (bias in favour of counter examples currently in the MCC)[https://yanntm.github.io/MCC-analysis/invcex/invcex.html].

GreatSPN is a versatile and very reliable tool practically always scoring 100% reliability over many editions of the MCC.
 
The first commit in this folder is a direct extraction from the VM submitted in MCC 2023 and available from the MCC site.
