## GreatSPN (GRaphical Editor and Analyzer for Timed and Stochastic Petri Nets) 

Following description adapted from their website,

GreatSPN is a software package for the modeling, validation, and performance evaluation of distributed systems using Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets and their colored extension, Stochastic Well-formed Nets. The tool provides a friendly framework to experiment with (stochastic) Petri net based modeling techniques. It implements efficient analysis algorithms to allow its use on rather complex applications.

GreatSPN is a tool released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2.

## GreatSPN in MCC
 
GreatSPN competed in the MCC from the 2013 edition and continuously up to 2023.

The current engine used in MCC scenarios is based on [Meddly](https://github.com/asminer/meddly) a powerful decision diagram library and uses very general decision procedures able to deal with CTL* formulas.

GreatSPN embeds its own analysis methods for Colored nets thus can deal with all models, and can handle every examination of the MCC, making it a versatile tool.

In terms of rankings, it is [regularly on the podium for StateSpace](https://yanntm.github.io/MCC-analysis/state_space_annual.html).
While it is a solid tool and reliable tool, it suffers in the MCC scoring from the [bias in favour of counter examples currently in the MCC](https://yanntm.github.io/MCC-analysis/invcex/invcex.html) and from the absence of any explicit state decision procedure in the usage of GreatSPN made in the MCC workflow (note these components do exist in the GreatSPN tool suite).

Still, it can in all categories answer hard queries other tools cannot, since the Meddly based engine is quite strong at building the whole state space.
This is represented by the small red and green bars in [these diagrams](https://yanntm.github.io/MCC-analysis/invcex/toolinvcexhard.html).

GreatSPN is a versatile and very reliable tool practically always scoring 100% reliability over many editions of the MCC.

## Edits and changes

The first commit in this folder is a direct extraction from the VM submitted in MCC 2023 and available from the MCC site.
 
 This is a list of adaptations that were added to the original driver.
     
 * Hard coded references to /home/mcc/BenchKit/ and links to /opt/greatspn are replaced by use of $BK_BIN_PATH and subfolders of this one.
 * "Portable greatspn" distribution is relocated to a subfolder of this one
